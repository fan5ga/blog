Recovering surgical scene structure in endoscopic surgery is crucial step for surgical guidance and augmented reality applications. We designed a quasi dense reconstruction algorithm based on a state-of-the-art SLAM system, and is exploiting the initial exploration phase that is typically performed by the surgeon at the beginning of the surgery. Our framework tracks the movement of the endoscopic camera and simultaneously reconstructs a semi dense geometric mesh of the MIS scene.
The whole scheme is shown as below:
