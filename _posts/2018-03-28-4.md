**Purpose:** The purpose of this paper is to propose a robust and real-time 3D (three-dimensional) vision system for sorting objects on a moving conveyor belt with an RGB-D sensor. <br>
**Design/methodology/approach:** The sorting process requires concurrent recognition and grasping of objects to separate different or undesired items from among those flowing on the conveyor belt. This process consists of looking at the items distributed on the conveyor belt, localizing any single item, and classifying it on the basis of features that make it acceptable. In contrast to many conveyor object recognition systems, which rely simply on a 2D feature or 3D shape that is sensitive to environment changes, the proposed approach depends on 3D features and can identify an object, locate it, and estimate its 3D pose.  <br>
**Findings:** Our proposed approach is effective in cluttered and occluded environments. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using real experiments with a conveyor belt and several objects. <br>
**Originality/value**: A 3D vision system for a conveyor belt sorting process that deals with both textured and texture-less objects in partial occlusion is proposed.
