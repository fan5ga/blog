## Low-Cost Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning System Using GPS/INS


<br><br>
### Research Participants:
1. **Dr. Kim yun-ki:** Program leader, Algorithm Development
2. **Longtan Wang:** Algorithm Development and implementation in Matlab, Embedded system implementation, Evaluation 
3. **Kim Jin-ho:** Outdoor tests    
<br>

### Sponsor:
1. [Hanwha Systems](http://www.hanwhasystems.com) (Former **Samsung Thalex**)    
<br>    

Also known as **PDR (Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning) system for ([Unattended Ground Surveillance System (UGSS)](http://www.hanwhasystems.com/eng/business/business.do?page=12))**    
This system is specially designed for Samsung Thalex’s Unattended Ground Surveillance System (UGSS).<br>
The position of soldier during wartime is very important to not only solider himself but his leaders. During wartime GPS could be affected or hijacked and could not function properly. Our system is specially designed for control of disposition of forces and individual soldier’s navigation during wartime. 
The PDR system can be used to predict how far the pedestrian moves from the initial location by using the information regarding the pedestrian’s steps. Such walking information as step length, directions, poses and height can be obtained by using IMU (Inertia Measurement Unit).
